First, we’ve launched a brand-new website where you can find all the latest updates, resources, and information about our events. We’re also expanding our presence on social media—you can now connect with us on LinkedIn and Bluesky. Be sure to follow us there to stay in the loop and engage with the community between meetups.
We’re really looking forward to growing this group together and making this a vibrant, welcoming space for R enthusiasts of all levels. Thank you for being part of this journey with us."
